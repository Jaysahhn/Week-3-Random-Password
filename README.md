# Week-3-Random-Password

## Description
Displaying my ability to create a random password generator by manipulating Javascript During this challenge, I demonstrated my ability to create variables to hold values, use while loop to constantly repeat until the user provides a satisfactory answer, IFs and ELSE to prompt the user with dialog boxes that have requirements for their password, using CONFIRM, PROMPT, and ALERT, and the usage of a FOR Loop to randomly choose one of the characters in the password and rounds that number into a whole number then returns that character's index.

## Usage
This screenshot shows the deployed website which shows a 50 character randomly generated password including numbers, letters, symbols, and upper and lowercase letters.
